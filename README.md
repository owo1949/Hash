Project Status: Core Algorithm Logic (Pseudo-code)

This repository provides the core algorithmic logic and pseudo-code implementation for the paper "Hash-HIT: Frequency-Aware and Class-Adaptive Implicit Modeling of Human Internal Tissues."

Notice regarding full source code: The full implementation of the proposed framework is currently subject to commercial licensing restrictions and pending intellectual property (IP) protection processes. Consequently, we are unable to release the complete training pipeline and source code at this stage.
